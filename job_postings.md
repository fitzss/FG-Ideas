## How to use this list today

- Search each company + role on LinkedIn/Indeed (U.S., add MI/OH/IN/IL/WI filter first).
- Prioritize JDs that mention AMR/AGV + WMS/MES, doors/elevators/conveyors/chargers, Ignition/Kepware/ControlLogix/TIA, validation/Part 11, multi-site templates, no planned downtime.
- For each posting, note the one first loop you’d propose (e.g., WMS order → AMR → door interlock → conveyor + signed audit log) and save the exact JD lines you’ll reference in outreach.

# Furniture & Home Goods Mfg + DC Intralogistics (New Vertical)

> Why this vertical: high conveyor/door/elevator handoff surface area, mixed-vendor equipment, and constant SKU/mix changes → perfect for FleetGlue’s cross-system orchestration (WMS↔AMR/AGV↔conveyors/doors), **no-downtime** policy changes, and **signed audit logs**.

## How to use this list (same playbook as other verticals)

- **Search syntax (LI/Indeed/company sites):**  
  `("AMR" OR "AGV" OR "autonomous mobile robot") AND (WMS OR MES OR Ignition OR Kepware OR "ControlLogix") AND (conveyor OR door OR elevator OR charger)`

- **Qualify fast (keep/skip):** keep postings that mention *AMR/AGV + WMS/MES* and at least one *handoff* (conveyor/door/elevator/charger) or *policy* (traffic/safety/charger scheduling).

- **Propose a single loop:** *WMS order → AMR mission → door/elevator interlock → conveyor handoff + signed audit log.* Promise **≤1-day TTFV** and **no planned downtime** for policy/version changes.

- **Measure the pilot:** *TTFV (hours), mission success %, exceptions auto-resolved, # of signed logs*.
