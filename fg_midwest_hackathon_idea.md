# Subject: Midwest hackathon to seed a hireable “Factory Orchestrator” bench

Tim Cook has pointed out that **China’s edge is not cheap labor but the depth of hands-on manufacturing skill.**  
FleetGlue tackles the same root issue for the U.S. by building depth in automation orchestration.  
We make mixed-brand fleets safe to run, easy to change, and we turn fixes into reusable blocks.  
That creates a new champion user in the plant.

## Proposal
Run a **FleetGlue hackathon** to create and certify the “Factory Orchestrator.”

---

## What it is
- **Focus on the Provider layer:** adapters, blocks, and small cross-brand workflows.  
- **Partner with Producers and Consumers:** OEMs and SIs provide test hardware or sims; plant teams provide real scenarios.  
- **Each team ships a working loop:** connect a device, self-describe, run a cross-brand mission that touches two systems, produce a signed audit log.

---

## Why Midwest (Detroit and Ann Arbor)
- Close to **auto, EV, aerospace, food and beverage, and defense suppliers.**  
- Strong **university and maker communities** along the I-94 corridor.  
- Easier follow-on pilots with local plants and integrators.

---

## What it produces
- **Working loops** on FleetGlue that demonstrate our “plug in and orchestrate” promise.  
- **Reusable assets:** adapters, blocks, playbooks, and audit templates we can publish.  
- **Hireable people:** participants earn **L1 and L2 certificates** that signal they can deploy and run mixed-brand automation in real plants.

---

## Who benefits
- **Plant managers:** a new operator class that can stand up and maintain mixed fleets without vendor lock-in.  
- **Providers:** SIs and OEM partners get a bench of certified doers who reduce project risk and time to value.  
- **FleetGlue:** more reusable blocks, more Midwest proof points, and a community aligned to our rules for “safe” and “proven.”

---

## Why this supports reindustrialization
- Builds a domestic bench of orchestration talent similar to how tool-and-die depth powered prior manufacturing waves.  
- Converts one-off integrations into shared building blocks that raise the baseline capability of U.S. plants.  
- Creates a clear, hireable role profile that schools, workforce boards, and providers can train toward.

---

## Success metrics
- **Number of adapters and blocks** produced and reused.  
- **Time to first mission** and mission success rate.  
- **Number of participants** who earn L1 and L2 certificates and are placed with plants or SIs within 60 to 90 days.

If this direction is useful, I can draft the **one-pager, the L1 and L2 rubric, a short sponsor list, and a timeline** targeting a first Midwest event.
